		<h1>Fluffy Cake</h1>
		<p>This page has the recipe for fluffy cake. Fluffy cake is glorified box cake. It is pretty easy but its also really good. <br> This recipe is my grandma's, she often made it for birthdays or holidays. For this recipe, we use box cake, but any german chocolate cake recipe will work. It's the same for the vanilla pudding, we tend to use Jello's French Vanilla instant pudding, but a good vanilla pudding recipe mixed with some orange extract does the same.<br>

	<h2>Tips and substitutes</h2>
	<p>You can use any kind of french vanilla pudding and german chocolate cake, it does not have to be instant, that will raise the cook and prep time though. Props to you though, I'm lazy. <br>
	Unfortunatly, there are no substitues for orange extract. It it a must. <br>
	You can subtitute the geramn chocolate bar for any other chocolate, but it may change the taste of the icing.<br>
	You could make your own whipped cream icing, but I would advise using cool whip because it is less likly to melt.</p>

	<h2>Recipe</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Follow the directions on your cake mix boxes</li>
		<li>Once you have two german chocolate cakes, cut both of them  in half so you have 4 layers. Set those aside to cool. </li>
		<li>Make the instant pudding by combining the mix to 4 cups of  milk. Mix this thoroughly, then add 2 tsp of orange extract, or more if you really like oranges. </li> 
		<li>Next you have to make the icing. Break up the chocolate bar into chunks, then either using a microwave or double boiler, melt it.</li>
		<li>Heat the chocolate until there are no remaining chunks,then let it cool but don't let it solidify.</li>
		<li> Add 1 1/2 of you tubs of cool whip into an electric mixer  (you may need more or less cool whipe depending on the size of the cake). Once the chocolate is cool, pour it into the mixer and mix until smooth. If the chocolate forms chunks, that means you didn't let it cool enough. It might not look as good but it will taste fine. </li>
		<li>Now you need to assemble the cake. Take the cool whip       mixture and create a border around the edge of the first layer. Spood the pudding into the center as a filling, the layer of pudding should be about 1/4 in thick.Then stack the next layer on top and repeat with the other two. Do not put pudding on the top layer.</li>
		<li>Finally, use the remaining cool whip on the outside of the  cake as icing and decorate however you'd like.</li>
