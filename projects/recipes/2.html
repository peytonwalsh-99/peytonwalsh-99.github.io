		<h1>Fluffy Cake</h1>
		<p>This page has the recipe for fluffy cake. Fluffy cake is made from German Chocolate box cake, instant pudding and cool whip. It is an easy but good cake. <br> This recipe is my grandma's, she often made it for birthdays or holidays. For this recipe, we use box cake, but any german chocolate cake recipe will work. It's the same for the vanilla pudding, we tend to use Jello's French Vanilla instant pudding, but a good vanilla pudding recipe mixed with some orange extract does the same.<br>
