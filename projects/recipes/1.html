		<h2>Tips and substitutes</h2>
		<p>You can use any kind of milk, dairy or non-dairy and it will stay the same. <br>If you don't have vegitable oil, you can use the same amount of melted butter. <br> If you don't have white sugar, brown sugar works fines. <br> Whole wheat flower can also be used instead of all-purpose, but only use 1 1/4 cups.</p>
